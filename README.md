SarynPaint is a simple paint program written for my friend Saryn when she was about two years old. At the time her computer skills were pretty much limited to swinging the mouse around on the screen. This program was designed so that she could create something while doing that.  When Saryn was somewhat older she kindly recorded the audio cues for the program.  You can run it [here](http://trebor.github.io/sarynpaintjs/).  For best effect set your browser to full screen mode.

This project is a javascript port of the original, and now deperecated, [java implementation of SarynPaint](https://github.com/trebor/sarynpaint). This code is released under the terms of the [MIT Licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
